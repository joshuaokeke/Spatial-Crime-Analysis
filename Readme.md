## Introduction

This lab focuses on analyzing crime data using spatial statistics techniques. We'll start by loading the data and then proceed with density mapping, converting data into spatstat point pattern objects, performing quadrat analysis, and exploring distance-based functions.

## Part 1: Loading Data

We begin by loading the crime data and the shapefile for city limits. The crime data contains information about different types of crimes in St. Louis.

## Part 2: Density Maps

We create density maps of gun homicide data using kernel density estimation with different bandwidths. The commentary discusses the most suitable bandwidth choice for visualization.

## Part 3: Spatstat Point Pattern Object

We convert the crime data into a spatstat point pattern object and analyze its nearest neighbor distances to determine if the pattern is clustered or evenly-spaced.

## Part 4: Quadrat Analysis

We perform a quadrat analysis on the hit-and-run crime data to determine if the pattern exhibits clustering, regularity, or randomness.

## Part 5: Distance-based Functions

We compute various distance-based functions, including G, F, K, L functions, and the pair correlation function, to further analyze the spatial distribution of gun homicide data.

## Conclusion
This lab provides hands-on experience with spatial statistics techniques for analyzing crime data. By applying these methods, we gain insights into the spatial patterns and distributions of different types of crimes, which can inform decision-making and crime prevention strategies.
